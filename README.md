# Code-Refactoring-Homework
In this assignment HTML code was refactored to make navigation throughout the website an easier process. div elements were removed and replaced with headers, footers, section tags, etc.
Alt tags were also added to the images so developers who are going over the code can have a better understanding of what they are looking at.
Also in this assignment CSS Code was made more efficient by combining portions of the CSS that were seperated to make the CSS code look much cleaner.
